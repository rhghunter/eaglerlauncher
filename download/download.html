                    <h2>V1.0</h2>
                    <p>This version didn't start with much. It only started with the Main Launcher & the servers list. Those were the only features within the Launcher. That concludes version 1.0.</p>

                    <h2>V1.1</h2>
                    <p>This version added a bunch of new stuff. The first thing that was added was the license agreement. To access the license agreement you would hit the "Terms of Use" button. The next thing that was added is the launcher version at the bottom of every page. Another thing was the Changelog so that we can keep track of updates. We also had to add the Changelog access button to every page. I also found icons for every page to try to keep the Launcher looking good. Another thing that I have done is added descriptions to every server on the servers list (Caused servers list to not look good). I also added the Launcher version & that version's release date to the bottom of every page. For contact purposes I added my email to every page. That concludes version 1.1.</p>

                    <h2>V1.2</h2>
                    <p>I started by separating JavaScript & CSS code from the html files & I put that code into its own files. I also fixed the whole description issue for the servers. Now in order to see the description you have to click on the server card. I also added some animations to the Launcher just to make it look a little better. I implemented some security to the website. I fixed the copy right year at the bottom of the servers page. Another thing I did was add the downloads page to the Main Launcher's page. I then put the download button on every page. I also changed the style of the text that says that this is an unofficial Eaglercraft Launcher. I changed the location of the navigation buttons while also making them look better. That concludes version 1.2.</p>
